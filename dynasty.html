  <h1>FEMISM</h1>
  <h2>IVY WANGECHI'S MURDER</h2>
  <img src="./IMG/wangechi1.jpg alt="">
  <p>Ivy was a 6th year medical student who was hacked to death by her stalker named naftali kinuthia .</p>
  <p>Naftali drove all the way to eldoret referal hospital from nairobi.He then got out of the car and hit her with an axe behind her head.He then slit her throat with a knife before getting in the getaway car.luckily bystander backaded the road and amersed on him a massive mass beating before he was saved by the police. </p>

  <p>To my understanding the only way a person would do such a thing  is due to the following: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>he was mentally unstable</li>
          <li>jelousy</li>
          <li>obsession</li>
        </ul>
